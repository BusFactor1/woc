woc - word occurance
--------------------

This program is designed to replace these lines of search.ksh shell
script:

    for file in $storydir/*; do
            echo $file:$(grep $invert -i -o -- "${word/-/}" $file | wc -l)
    done

It counts the occurances how many times word occures in the given
files.  It prints the "filename\tcount" as output.

Results
-------

before woc (with above lines of shell script):

time ./search.ksh arc tutorial
real   0m1.67s
user   0m0.03s
sys    0m0.26s

after replacing above loop with woc:

time ./search.ksh arc tutorial
real   0m0.07s
user   0m0.00s
sys    0m0.02s

Pass.

Missing
-------

-v or invert search (how many times a word doesn't occure?).  I am
really unsure of how this can be implemented and how grep was doing it
in the above invocation.  Maybe I'll figure it out someday.
