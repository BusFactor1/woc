woc - word occurance
--------------------

This program is designed to count the number of occurances of a set of
words in a set of files and produce a score listing.  It's a poor
man's google for the unix filesystem.

usage: woc [words...] -- [files or directories...]

Putting a '-' in front of a word will invert it's count value in the
results.

If a directory is specified after --, all of the files in that
directory will be scanned.
