TODO

-- ignore whitespace sequences when word is actually multiple words.
   this will allow for matching of words across newline boundaries and
   with varying degrees/types of whitespace between the words.

-- ||ize, probably 2 or more threads per cpu as this will be i/o
     bound, with mailbox to pass info from main thread to worker
     threads


DONE

-- have the last paramter be a directory rather than list of files;
   allows the removal of the -- seperator, and stops the requirement
   for the shell to expand all of the filenames prior to invoking woc
   Note: still required -- as seperator, but I don't think that is a
   problem.
